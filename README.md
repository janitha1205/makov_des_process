# integarated approach for decesion support mechanisum

as a data gethering, essentially subject monto calose simulation to extract data from model of paticular distribution such as normal, uniform or binomial type

then fed the data into makov decesion process with paticular labelled data, as input, employed output the moto calose simulation

finally as per scores taken as output for makov des process and decesion being evaluate basis of parato analysis

output for the method garateed the fair desesion in order to support unkown desesion support system without any know how of the system in way of blackbox type situation. this is just a assured simulation of natural phenomina where we only kown the behavior like input output cases.
